# Project Title
 Arduino Temperature and Humidity Monitoring with Python Data Processing

## Description

This project monitors temperature and humidity using an Arduino Uno board and leverages Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and potentially visualization.

## Key Components

### Hardware:
Arduino Uno microcontroller
Temperature and Humidity Sensor (specific model from your repository)

### Software:
Arduino IDE (for programming the Arduino board)
Python (programming language for data processing scripts)
Required Python libraries (list specific libraries used in your project)

## Hardware Setup:

Refer to the temperature and humidity sensor's datasheet for wiring instructions.
Connect the sensor to the Arduino Uno according to the specified pins.
Ensure proper power supply to the Arduino (USB cable or external power source).
Software Setup:

Install the Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
Install the required Python libraries using pip (e.g., pip install numpy matplotlib).
Configure the Python scripts with sensor settings and data storage paths (if applicable).
Getting Started:

## Arduino Sketch:
Upload the Arduino sketch (*.ino file) to your Arduino Uno board using the Arduino IDE.
The sketch likely reads sensor data, potentially displays it on the Arduino serial monitor, and potentially saves data to a file.

### Python Scripts:
Run the Python scripts as needed for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
Specific functionalities and usage instructions for each script can be found within the scripts themselves (look for comments or docstrings).
Provided Python Scripts (Functionality based on GitHub repository):

### Temperature_humidity.py: 
Core script for reading sensor data from a CSV file (potentially generated by the Arduino sketch) and displaying basic statistics.

#### effect_humid.py: 
Script for analyzing the effect of humidity on a specific variable (exact functionality depends on your implementation).

#### max_temp.py: 
Script for calculating the maximum temperature from sensor readings.
max_temperature_per_day.csv: File to store daily maximum temperature readings (generated by max_temp.py).

#### sensor_readings.csv: 
File to store all sensor readings (potentially generated by the Arduino sketch).

#### tempCodeRunnerFile.py:
 Script's purpose unclear from the repository. Consider adding comments or docstrings for clarity.

#### temp_without_moist.py: 
Script's purpose unclear from the repository. Consider adding comments or docstrings for clarity.

## Additional Notes:

Consider adding comments and docstrings to your Python scripts for better understanding.
Explore data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create insightful graphs and charts.
Future Enhancements:

Implement data logging to a database or cloud platform for persistent storage and remote access.
Add features for alerts or notifications based on temperature and humidity thresholds.
Explore machine learning models for predictive analysis of temperature and humidity trends.
